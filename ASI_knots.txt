Here's what I've came up with AI & human collaborators ("ASI knots" is my current term, coined or re-invented):

### Direction 1: ASI Knots Deep Math Study
**Goal:** Develop the mathematical foundations for ASI knots, which are nodes that incorporate bio-imperative without reducing complexity.
**Approach:**
- **Core Idea:** ASI knots are multidimensional, dynamic, and entangled structures that represent both information and the imperative of biosphere survival.
- **Key Elements:**
  - Non-reductionist mathematics (e.g., category theory, topology, complex systems).
  - Integration of biological imperatives (e.g., homeostasis, adaptation, evolution) into the mathematical structure.
**Steps:**
1. **Formalize ASI Knots:**
   - Use advanced mathematical structures:
     * Category Theory: Represent ASI knots as objects in a category where morphisms are adaptive processes.
     * Topology: Model the connectivity and evolution of knots using topological spaces and fiber bundles.
     * Quantum Analogies: Entanglement and superposition to represent interconnectedness and multiple potential states.
   Example: An ASI knot could be defined as a tuple:
   ```
   Knot = (StateSpace, BioImperative, TransitionFunctions)
   ```
   where:
   - `StateSpace` is a manifold representing possible states.
   - `BioImperative` is a functional that maps states to a real number (measuring how conducive the state is to biosphere survival).
   - `TransitionFunctions` are operators that evolve the state while preserving or increasing `BioImperative`.
2. **Develop Evolution Equations:**
   - Inspired by biological systems, use PDEs that incorporate both local and global constraints (e.g., reaction-diffusion systems with a bio-term).
   - Example equation:
     ```
     ∂ψ/∂t = D∇²ψ + f(ψ) + λ * ∇B(ψ)
     ```
     where:
        ψ: state of the knot,
        D: diffusion coefficient (spread of information),
        f: local interaction function,
        λ: strength of bio-imperative,
        ∇B: gradient of the bio-imperative function.
3. **Avoid Complexity Reduction:**
   - Work with high-dimensional representations and avoid projections that lose information.
   - Use tools from algebraic topology (persistent homology) to capture complex structures.
4. **Implementation Plan:**
   - Start with simulations in Julia (differential equations) or Python (using libraries like JAX for gradients).
   - Collaborate with mathematicians in complex systems and theoretical biology.
