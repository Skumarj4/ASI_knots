# ðŸ§ ðŸ¤–ðŸª¢ ASI Knots â€” Modeling Intelligence, Ecology, Complex Systems

A compact toolkit for exploring "Artificial Superintelligence Knots" (ASI Knots). This repo ties knot theory, ecology, and systems math into models you can run and inspect. Use the releases to get runnable builds and scripts.

Overview
ASI Knots explores coupled networks that bind intelligence, biosphere dynamics, ethics, and long-term persistence. The project frames high-level AGI risk and ecological dynamics as knot structures. Each knot encodes constraints, feedback loops, and transfer functions. The code provides tools to build, compare, and simulate knot models.

Why ASI Knots
- Model interdependent systems that matter to long-term outcomes.
- Study how control, goals, and resource loops form stable or fragile structures.
- Link mathematical knots to state-space constraints and attractors.
- Use the project to test policy approaches, ethical constraints, and rescue heuristics in simulated biospheres.

Key features
- Core knot primitives: trefoil, figure-eight, and composite knots mapped to control graphs.
- Dynamics engine: integrate ODEs and discrete updates in coupled systems.
- Ethics frames: layered constraints that modulate goal functions and reward flows.
- Visualization: 2D knot render, force layout, phase portraits.
- Export: CSV, JSON, and image outputs for further analysis.
- CLI and Python API.

Core concepts (plain)
- Knot as constraint graph: A knot is a set of loops and crossings. Map loops to subsystems (AI control, biosphere, economy). Map crossings to resource transfer, delay, and feedback.
- Attractor knot: A region of state space where dynamics settle. Stable knots trap unwanted outcomes. We test methods to avoid bad attractors.
- Ethical modulus: A modular function applied to the agent reward. The modulus shapes gradients and can cut or soften reward channels.
- Eternity engine: A scheduler for long-horizon weighting. It sets how much the system values distant futures.
- Noosphere coupling: A term for cultural and information-layer feedback. It links agents and biosphere via memetic flows.

Math and models (practical)
- Represent a knot as a directed multigraph G = (V, E, C) where V are subsystems, E are transfer edges, and C are crossing constraints.
- Each node v has state x_v(t), dynamic xÌ‡_v = f_v(x, u, t). Edges carry flows F_e = g_e(x_src, x_dst, params).
- Crossing constraint c modifies flows: F'_e = c(F_e, x, t). Use multiplicative or saturating forms.
- Use Lyapunov checks on subgraphs to evaluate local stability.
- Compute Jacobian J to detect bifurcations. Track eigenvalues to see attractor changes when ethics modules change.

Install and run
Download the release asset and execute the included installer or runner from the Releases page. Visit and download the release from: https://github.com/Skumarj4/ASI_knots/releases

Typical steps (example)
- Download latest archive or installer from the Releases page.
- Unpack and run the install script or the binary.

Example commands (Linux / macOS)
```bash
# Example: download a release asset (replace tag and file name)
curl -L -o ASI_knots-v1.0.0.tar.gz \
  https://github.com/Skumarj4/ASI_knots/releases/download/v1.0.0/ASI_knots-v1.0.0.tar.gz

tar -xzf ASI_knots-v1.0.0.tar.gz
cd ASI_knots-v1.0.0
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh

# Run a demo scenario
./run_scenario.sh --config scenarios/trefoil_ecology.yaml
```

If the release link fails or you see no assets, check the Releases section on the repo page and pick the right artifact.

Quick Python install (if Python wheel or source is available)
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Skumarj4/ASI_knots.git
```

Examples and scenarios
- demo/trefoil_ecology.yaml â€” A trefoil knot that represents three sectors: core AGI, biosphere, and supply chain. It shows oscillation and eventual stabilization under strong ethical modulus.
- demo/figure8_contest.yaml â€” Two competing agents form a figure-eight knot. The system tests policy arbitration and resource theft dynamics.
- notebooks/visualize_phase.ipynb â€” Plot phase space and knot maps for small networks.

Run a simple model (Python API)
```python
from asiknots import KnotModel, TrefoilBuilder, EthicsModule

k = TrefoilBuilder().with_params(loop_gain=0.8).build()
eth = EthicsModule(modulus_type='saturating', cap=0.1)
model = KnotModel(k, ethics=eth)
result = model.run(t_span=(0, 100), steps=1000)
model.plot(result, save='trefoil_phase.png')
```

Outputs and visualizations
- Phase portraits (PNG, SVG)
- Time series CSV for each node
- Network JSON for graph analysis
- Interactive HTML pages that embed knot visuals and sliders

Contributing
- Open an issue for small ideas or bugs.
- Fork, branch, make a clear commit, and open a pull request.
- Add tests that cover new dynamics or new knot primitives.
- Use unit tests for numeric stability checks and tolerance bounds.

Design tips for new scenarios
- Map each real-world sector to one or more loops.
- Use edges to represent resource flow, attention, or control.
- Model delays explicitly. Delays can flip stability.
- Add ethics modules early. They reduce the chance of runaway gradients.
- Test with a range of initial conditions.

Testing and validation
- Run unit tests: python -m pytest tests/
- Use deterministic seeds for stochastic models.
- Validate attractor detection with multiple solvers and step sizes.
